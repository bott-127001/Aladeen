## 2. Milestone Acceptance: MSM Dashboard Integration
- **Accepted Milestone**: Market Structure Marking (MSM) Read-Only Dashboard Integration.
- **Accepted Commit Hash**: `133a76f1663bf0a940cc6ac2972a7bb86151832d` (`fix(strategy): bundle candidate envelope, preserve shared session, and verify browser races (HANDOFF-016)`)
- **Reviewer Status**: **ACCEPTED** by Perplexity for the bounded MSM dashboard scope, with recorded verification boundaries.
- **Accepted Implementations**:
  1. Synchronous browser-side request issuance (`CLIENTSIDE_REQUEST_ISSUANCE_JS`) generating unique request tokens and context before dispatch.
  2. Single candidate result envelope (`market-candidate-envelope-store`) bundling `{request_token, snapshot, connection_event}` atomically.
  3. Strict client-side acceptance gate (`CLIENTSIDE_ACCEPTANCE_GATE_JS`) enforcing token and context invariants prior to publication in `market-data-store`.
  4. Isolation of adapter lifecycle: removed request-local `adapter.disconnect()` from stale-capable fetch error paths, preserving active shared MT5 sessions.
  5. 1-based structural numbering (`H1`, `L1`), explicit support/resistance lines, and strict manual direction/start validation.

### Recorded Verification Boundaries:
- **Browser Race Testing Characterization**: The browser tests in `tests/test_browser_race_controlled.py` are **stale-envelope injection tests** using `window.dash_clientside.set_props()` into `market-candidate-envelope-store` after newer data has been accepted. They verify that `CLIENTSIDE_ACCEPTANCE_GATE_JS` executes in the browser, rejects stale tokens, and preserves accepted stores. They do **not** claim proof of concurrent network-level overlapping HTTP fetch resolution in the browser.
- **Browser Error Evidence**: The controlled race tests verify zero uncaught browser page errors (`page.on('pageerror')`). The separate live terminal workflow (`tests/browser_check.py`) verified 0 browser console errors across all 8 flows.
- **Store Observation Boundary**: The test verifies that `connection-loss-trigger` is not updated; because that store is memory-backed, direct inspection in the browser is constrained to React state and absence of UI error banners/badge changes.

## 3. Milestone Acceptance: CHOCH Requirements & Acceptance Specification
- **Accepted Milestone**: Change of Character (CHOCH) Acceptance Specification & Fixture Validation.
- **Accepted Commit Hash**: `7d5e3aedeff3548b2cf35fa41833f6948ad8d82f` (HANDOFF-019)
- **Reviewer Status**: **ACCEPTED** by Perplexity as the source-settled CHOCH requirements baseline, with the Point-3 identification-close question ($c_1 == p_2$) explicitly isolated as unresolved pending source reconciliation.
- **Key Baseline Requirements**:
  1. Two consecutive completed closes strictly beyond confirmed level (`close < last_support` for Bearish, `close > last_resistance` for Bullish).
  2. Strict closing price comparison: exact equality touch fails closed; wick pierces without closing break fail closed.
  3. Candle color independence: closing price rule is independent of red/green candle colors.
  4. Active tentative Point 3 required: Point 3 anchored to identified swing candle; continuation break resets tentative status.
  5. Isolated same-close interpretation ($c_1 == p_2$): strictly before identification ($< p_2$) is ineligible; strictly after ($c_1 \ge p_2 + 1$) is source-settled; simultaneous close ($c_1 == p_2$) emits an unresolved diagnostic without forced boolean outcome.
  6. Three original-candle zones: SBR (`[low, LB]`), RBS (`[UB, high]`), QML / A+ (`[UB, high]` for upward, `[low, LB]` for downward), Double Top/Bottom.
  7. Zero-wick zones preserved as thickness-0 horizontal price lines (`is_line = true`).
  8. Cycle termination and restart: prior cycle ends; direction reverses; restart reference is Point 3 original candle; first pullback in new direction must occur strictly after confirmation bar ($p_1 \ge c_2 + 1$).
  9. Pre-CHOCH MSM prerequisites independently verified via `test_end_to_end_msm_prerequisites_match_msm_engine`.

## 4. Milestone Acceptance: CHOCH Strategy Engine Implementation & Lifecycle Hardening
- **Accepted Milestone**: Pure Offline CHOCH Strategy Engine Implementation.
- **Accepted Commit Hash**: `86b247f9` (HANDOFF-023)
- **Reviewer Status**: **ACCEPTED** by Perplexity with standing authorization for ISS requirements phase.

---

## 5. Milestone Acceptance: ISS Requirements & Acceptance Specification
- **Accepted Milestone**: Internal Structure Shift (ISS) Acceptance Specification & Boundary Hardening.
- **Accepted Commit Hash**: `c6e58a26ef7d813e8bc884bbb8ac285440e9649d` (HANDOFF-027)
- **Reviewer Status**: **ACCEPTED** by Perplexity as bounded ISS requirements baseline.

## 6. Milestone Acceptance: Pure Offline ISS Strategy Engine Implementation
- **Accepted Milestone**: Pure Offline ISS Strategy Engine Implementation (`HANDOFF-030`).
- **Accepted Commit Hash**: `4948ea5c326f65cc4d58b95c196801408f7dd7ef`
- **Reviewer Status**: **ACCEPTED** by Perplexity with instruction to proceed directly to offline and dashboard integration.
- **Accepted Implementations**:
  1. Terminal precedence (R29.1): main continuation break taking place on the 5th-point candle takes precedence over ISS confirmation.
  2. Clean cancellation cleanup (R29.2): zero residual markings or zones on cancelled/rejected candidates.
  3. Unresolved progress reporting (R29.3): frozen authoritative `last_processed_index` alongside advancing `last_received_index`.
  4. Modular tracking extraction (`src/aladeen/strategy/iss_tracking.py`).

## 7. Current Milestone: ISS Dashboard Integration (HANDOFF-031 & HANDOFF-032)
- **Active Branch**: `feature/iss-dashboard`
- **Objective**: Integrate the accepted offline ISS Engine into the Aladeen / TopG read-only dashboard with deterministic browser verification.
- **Scope Boundary**: Pure offline strategy calculation and read-only dashboard presentation. **Strictly zero UI order execution, zero MT5 trading calls, zero TJL, zero zone activations, zero trade entry signals, zero automated trading, and zero merging to `main`**.
- **Completed Deliverables (HANDOFF-031 & HANDOFF-032)**:
  1. `src/aladeen/strategy/iss_types.py` & `src/aladeen/strategy/iss_engine.py`:
     - Added public `ISSCombinedResult` container bundling `(iss_snapshot, main_coordinator_snapshot, confirmed_iss_events)`.
     - Added public `ISSEngine.get_combined_result()` and `ISSEngine.get_main_coordinator_snapshot()`.
     - Zero private attribute access (`_main_coordinator`) from application service layer.
  2. `src/aladeen/strategy/service.py`:
     - Added `CalculationMode.INTEGRATED_MSM_CHOCH_ISS = "INTEGRATED_MSM_CHOCH_ISS"`.
     - Added `show_iss_markers`, `show_iss_zones`, `show_iss_points` to `MSMContext`.
     - Integrated `ISSEngine` via public `get_combined_result()`.
  3. `src/aladeen/ui/chart.py`:
     - Stamped zone shapes with stable identifiers `name=f"iss_zone_{z_type_str.lower()}"` and `name=f"choch_zone_{z_type_str.lower()}"`.
     - Exactly two ISS zones rendered for confirmed event (Level 3 RBS/SBR and Level 4 Buying/Selling A+) starting horizontally strictly at `confirmation_availability_time`.
     - Unknown availability creates 0 zone shapes (zero speculative extension).
     - Zero-width zones rendered as horizontal lines (`y0 == y1`).
     - Markers anchored to candle open with tooltip distinguishing open anchor from confirmation close.
     - Tooltips explicitly labeled as structural events, not order entry signals.
  4. `src/aladeen/ui/msm_callbacks.py`:
     - Normalized dropdown ISO strings and UTC datetimes to prevent false unapplied draft warnings.
     - Rendered Candidate Identity card, 5-point structure table, Attempted/Tracking tables, Active Zones table, and Confirmed History table.
  5. `tests/test_iss_dashboard_integration.py`:
     - Cleaned `_make_snapshot_from_fixture` to preserve exact fixture timestamps without synthetic offsets.
     - Separated `test_continuation_cancellation_presentation` (exact `MAIN_CONTINUATION_CANCELLED`) and `test_genuine_tracking_only_presentation` (exact `OUTSIDE_RANGE_COMPLETION_TRACKING_ONLY`).
     - 15/15 offline integration tests pass in 1.61s.
  6. `tests/test_iss_browser_controlled.py`:
     - Deterministic Playwright verification across 9 scenarios using `ControllableISSMockAdapter` on port 8062:
       1. Bearish success (`iss_01`): chart coordinates, markers, zones, inspection text, CONFIRMED badge.
       2. Bullish success (`iss_02`): SBR & Selling A+ zones, CONFIRMED badge.
       3. Genuine tracking-only progression: `OUTSIDE RANGE COMPLETION (TRACKING ONLY — NOT ELIGIBLE)` badge, attempted & tracking points tables.
       4. Out-of-bounds rejection (`iss_05`): `OUT_OF_BOUNDS_REJECTED` badge, 0 active zones.
       5. Main-continuation cancellation (`iss_09`): `MAIN_CONTINUATION_CANCELLED` badge, 0 active zones.
       6. Unresolved-main presentation: `#unresolved-status-banner` with orange `#ff9800` border and frozen authoritative bar.
       7. Mode Apply vs unapplied draft edits: `"🟡 Unapplied changes"` vs `"🟢 Applied"`.
       8. ISS display toggles: unchecking markers/zones updates presentation without recalculation.
       9. Context switch / Refresh with shared revision: revision updates without improper retention.
       10. Error Accounting: 0 console errors, 0 page errors.
  7. Verification Summary:
     - 328 unit/integration tests pass in 9.77s.
     - 1 browser controlled test suite (9 scenarios) passes in 52.48s.
     - Total: 329 tests passing with 0 failures.
     - Rendered Candidate Identity card, Lifecycle Status badge, 5-Point Structure table, Tracking Points table, Active Zones table, and Confirmed ISS History table.
     - Unapplied draft edits isolation and unresolved ambiguity containment.
  5. `tests/test_iss_dashboard_integration.py`:
     - 13 comprehensive, deterministic offline integration tests covering service calculations, chart overlays, inspection panel tables, display toggle invariance, draft isolation, and unresolved state presentation.
- **Verification**: Full suite of 326 tests passing in 8.62s. Ready for HANDOFF-031 review.
